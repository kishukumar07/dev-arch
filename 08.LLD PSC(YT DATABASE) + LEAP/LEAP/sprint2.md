today we'll focus of the Live Coding interview round 
-LIVE CODING [REACTO]
####################
 

Purpose  => 
       over the past few days we are doing good with the evaluations and assignments but we are failing in their interviews. 
       Due to the following reasons 
  >JUMPING TO CODE DIRECTLY 
              >>read it carefully 
  >LACK IN EXPLAINING APPROACH WITH SUITABLE EXAMPLES
               >>First explain your approach to the interviwer then write the code ... naito he will tell you to apply it in better approach ..
  >NOT ABLE TO THINK EDGE CASES OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT 
  >LACK IN TESTING THE APPROACH(DRY RUN)


         <!-- We have [REACTO] FOR THAT -->
how to use REACTO IN AN INTERVIEW ?
