//Declaring a Variable 
let a: number = 10;
let b: String = "Masai";
let c: boolean = false;
// c = 10 ; //you can not reassing the c with value where value != declared datatype. 


//Arrays ...
let d: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; //array declaration and initilization ...



//Strings ...
let e: string[] = ["1", "2"];

//Tuples(Not part of JS)

//RGB(100,200,10) 
let RGB: [number, number, number] = [100, 200, 10]; //tuples -> limiting the number of elements that array can have; 

//if we want n=80  in that case array should be best choice;   
//tuples is only for possible count of element . eg 3/4/5 elements Only.... 

let code: [number, number, string] = [100, 200, "10"] //diff type of element is allowed in   




// any thing that can be done in js can not be done in js that is also the limitations of the ts ... ...





// seneario if you have to build a app for windows(microsoft) you have to use c#(built by microsoft) and  TS which is also built by microsoft thats why 
// a lot of syntex of ts is comming from c sharp .
