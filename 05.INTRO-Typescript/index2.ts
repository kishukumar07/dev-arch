/*
This concept is called Type Alias in TypeScript.

type GenderType = "Male" | "Female" | "Other";
â†’ This defines a custom type (alias) that restricts values to only these three strings .
*/


type GenderType = "Male"|"Female"|"Other" ;   

//UNIONS =>   '|' using unions we are defines what are the types that are going to be of a variable .

let gender:GenderType = "Female"; 

function isFemale(a:GenderType){
    return a==="Female" ; 
}

isFemale(gender) ; 

// Other_Usecase of unions:
 let  z: string | number = "p"; 
//   z=34;   // fine 
//   z=true; //this is not fine error 

//unions are similar to logical or operator in js  
// ||(JS + TS) and |(TS)  
//unions are only used to compare type values in ts 
//we use logical or operator to compare data values ;

if(z==="p" || z==="10"){      
    console.log("OK"); 
}

//if statement is part of js also when i mean that single pipe (union )is part of ts is mean only part of ts .. and when we use || operator it means it is both used at js || ts .
